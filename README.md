# glucose2

A Python, Sqlite, and Matplotlib project to chart my daily blood glucose levels.  

This is the 2nd major version of the software, which involves a significant refactoring. This new software supports tracking the average daily blood glucose reading over a long time period, e.g. years, not just months.  

This long term observation provides a means to watch the blood glucose trend as alternative medications are tried (e.g. Jardiance).
